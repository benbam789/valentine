          <strong>I don’t really know how to start this letter off but I just wanted to say a few things. I hope you have a wonderful Valentine’s Day and you feel the love and support from the community around you. From the small amount of time we’ve known each other I’ve really enjoyed hanging out and talking to you. You’re funny, quirky, beautiful, thoughtful, honest, and most importantly rooted in Christ. Your story and faithfulness inspires me so much because of everything you’ve persevered through. Your heart for justice in the world and desire to see everyone as God’s children speaks highly of your character. There’s just something about you that makes me want to be around you more and more. I look forward to continuing to grow our relationship and learn even more about you. I pray that God continues to be with you and bless you in life. P.S - Hope you like the cats!</strong>
